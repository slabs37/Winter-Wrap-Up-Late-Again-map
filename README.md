Most things that were done in the making of this level have been written [Here](https://pooyahaghi.ir/en/2025/07/14/making-a-vivify-beat-saber-level/)

# Why is it uploaded
So that others can learn from this map and hopefully fix something or improve in their own Vivify maps.
Most assets were created by me. Clouds were made by [Howard Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQcjsW8ldkw).
You can reuse all assets in this project in your own projects.
